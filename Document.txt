Using Ninject for Dependency Inject to decouple the components in the MVC application:
To create instance of IPersonRepository and inject it as a contructor parameter.

Using Mock
The PersonReposity is a mock implementation of the IPersonRepository interface. I do not implement the true functionality that a real repository would need. I just did enough to be able to write test page. 

I created the fake implementation and added 10000 random persons which makes the PersonRepository class a manual mock.
